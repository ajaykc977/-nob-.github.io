You can write articles, long mission statements, company policies, executive profiles, company awards\u002Fdistinctions, office locations, shareholder reports, whitepapers, media mentions and other pieces of content that don’t fit into a shorter, more succinct space.\n\nArticles – Good topics for articles include anything related to your company – recent changes to operations, the latest company softball game – or the industry you’re in. General business trends (think national and even international) are great article fodder, too.\n\nMission statements – You can tell a lot about a company by its mission statement. Don’t have one? Now might be a good time to create one and post it here. A good mission statement tells you what drives a company to do what it does.\n\nCompany policies – Are there company policies that are particularly important to your business? Perhaps your unlimited paternity\u002Fmaternity leave policy has endeared you to employees across the company.
